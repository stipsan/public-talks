# Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration. Use Jest.

## Meetup organized by ReactJS Oslo at Google Norway

# Instructions

You'll need at least NodeJS version 8.9.1 and yarn 1.6.0.

`yarn` will install everything you need to run the examples. To fire up the slides: `cd slides && yarn && yarn start`.

To run an example you can from the root do things like: `jest --projects examples/03* --watch`.
